# blockPuzzle
solves puzzle with priority queue

this is a python program which creates a graph where the nodes are the 14,950,080 possible states of the puzzle and there are 48,324,096 edges linking nodes in which a single move (tile slide) transforms one to the other.

a solution is found by a graph traversal in which priority is given based on a heuristic discovered by myself and my friend Mark Crawford while playing with a large sized exhibit of this puzzle at the Museum of Illusions in Philadephia on 02/19/25
